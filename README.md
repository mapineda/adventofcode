# Advent of Code
This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems along with a framework to participate in competitive solving. Solutions will be implemented in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python or Go. In 2024 I attempted AoC with TypeScript (before this repo was created) so for 2025 I'll use Python. 

All solutions will be implemented using Test Driven Development and Green, Red, Refactor methodology.

## Run code:
```python
python3 solutions.py 
```

## Run tests:
```python
python3 -m unittest test.py -v 
```
